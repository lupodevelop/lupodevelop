# lupodevelop: code, noise and strange ideas

I make small Gleam libraries, but the real work happens in a messy workshop of experiments. Based in Italy, I travel when I can and learn places by eating them. I scatter prototypes, scribbles, and tiny tools across projects. I follow stubborn curiosity, loud Italian punk, and strong coffee.

This is not a product page. Expect rough edges, quick ideas, and things that work well enough to be interesting.

**Repositories**

- 🔗 [sparkling](https://github.com/lupodevelop/sparkling)
- 🔗 [thrift](https://github.com/lupodevelop/thrift)
- 🔗 [str](https://github.com/lupodevelop/str)

Each repository has its own README and examples; this profile points the torch.

Also: my dog Echo (yes, like the bash command) moonlights as a code reviewer. Subtle approval example:

```bash
# Echo's review (canine logic)
# TAIL_WAG=1 if tail wagged, WOF=1 if 'wof' observed
TAIL_WAG=1
WOF=1
if [ "$TAIL_WAG" -eq 1 ] && [ "$WOF" -eq 1 ]; then
	echo "wof woof Approved ✅"
else
	echo "nope"
fi
# -> wof woof Approved ✅   (if both true)
```
